87. BoxComponentBase AutoWidth has been removed.

88. PanelBase KeyMap has been removed. Though we are planning to implement it in one of next releases.

89. Calendaer: Event and EventCollection classes has been renamed to EventModel and EventModelCollection.

90. ResourceManager Namespace is "App" by default. Any widget will share own client id in that namespace.

	Example (client side)
	
	//Old
	TextField1.setValue("Hello World!");

	//New
	App.TextField1.setValue("Hello World!");

	or

	//New
	#{TextField1}.setValue("Hello World!");

	You can set up an empty Namespace to get the same as it's in Ext.NET v1.

	Example

	<ext:ResourceManager runat="server" Namespace="" />

91. There is no ViewState on page by default, i.e. ResourceManager DisableViewState="true" by default.

	To get it back, set .DisableViewState="false" for ResourceManager.
	
92. ColumnLayout doesn't support FitHeight and Split options. 

	Please use HBox layout if you need this functionality.

93. The type of TextFieldBase Validator has been changed to JFunction (was string).

	Example

	//Old
	<ext:TextField runat="server" Validator="myValidator">

	//New
	<ext:TextField runat="server">
		<Validator Fn="myValidator" />
	</ext:TextField>

94. GridPanel Reload method doesn't reload its Store, don't use it.

	Use Store Reload method.
